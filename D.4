1.Introduction

Our project is to build an e-commerce store. By using our software, sellers can create their own web pages and manage their own web pages very easily. Sellers can add more than one administrator. Every administrator can edit the web pages. For example, putting new items on the web pages or hiding existing items, adding descriptions to items, and categorizing items already on the web pages. Managers can also upload pictures of goods so that consumers can shop more conveniently. Consumers can shop freely through our website. Add your favorite items to your shopping cart and change the number of products in the shopping cart.

Our e-commerce store can provide a takeaway website for some small businesses. And some new brands can use our e-store to set up their own official websites. Our aim is to provide convenience for entrepreneurs, as our e-store is a free service.

2.Implemented requirements

Functional requirements:
Stakeholders can adjust the layout of the web page to better match our characteristics.
Stakeholders can clear and concise interface and a fast response speed to make efficient shopping.
Stakeholders can  manage my shopping cart easily.
The platform can have an audit mechanism to improve the quality of customers.

Non-functional requirements
   Effectiveness - Web page response speed
  Security – 8 out of 10 testers are satisfied with our proposed security measures.
  Maintainability - Regularly test the function, safety and speed of the web page
  Compatibility - Being able to function properly with other applications and processes
   Availability - Web pages can be accessed by any user at any time.


3.Adopted technologies 

PHP : the main language we used to write the software
HTML : the second language we used to make our software look more user friendly
VARIABLES : we need to create and define some new variables
ARRAYS : we use ARRAYS to store a list of values
FUNCTIONS : we create some functions to make the code look simpler
LOOPS : we need to use this special method to realize the multiple repeated actions
POST and GET REQUEST: we use the POST and GET to collect form data after submitting an HTML form
MYSQL : we use MYSQL to connect with the database we create by ourselves. 

4.Learning/training 

PHP : PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
HTML : HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.
VARIABLES : Variable is a symbol or name that stands for a value. Variables are used for storing values such as numeric values, characters, character strings, or memory addresses so that they can be used in any part of the program.
ARRAYS : An array in PHP is actually an ordered map. A map is a type that associates values to keys. This type is optimized for several different uses; it can be treated as an array, list (vector), hash table (an implementation of a map), dictionary, collection, stack, queue, and probably more. 
FUNCTIONS : PHP functions are similar to other programming languages. A function is a piece of code which takes one more input in the form of a parameter and does some processing and returns a value.
LOOPS : Loops in PHP are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times. PHP supports the following four loop types.
for − loops through a block of code a specified number of times.
while − loops through a block of code if and as long as a specified condition is true.
do...while − loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as a special condition is true.
foreach − loops through a block of code for each element in an array.
POST and GET REQUEST : 
PHP $_POST is a PHP super global variable which is used to collect form data after submitting an HTML form with method="post". $_POST is also widely used to pass variables.
PHP $_GET is a PHP super global variable which is used to collect form data after submitting an HTML form with method="get".
MYSQL : MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is the most popular database system used with PHP. MySQL is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation.

5.Deployment

Description: 
Identify and understand our deployment audience.
Identify our deployment strategy early
Installation testing
Release regularly
Start planning early
Reduce your pre-production testing efforts safely over time.
Well-tested software is easier to deploy.
Our plan must reflect our organizational culture
Update our deployment plan regularly
Work backwards when deployment planning.
Have go/on-go decision points during the installation process.
Develop “de-installation” scripts.
Remember the data.
Announce the deployment
Understand the associated risks of deploying systems.
You may need to upgrade your user’s existing environments.
Training is an important part of deployment.
Develop supporting documentation.

6. Licensing

    We use an apache license. The license is in our Github. Link to license: https://github.com/YHL555/CS386/blob/master/ecom/public/LICENSE
We chose this license because it has large permissions and comprehensive permissions. By the license, we can use the source code.

8. Look & feel

    The store will communicate with Paypal to send requests for processing and will also receive data back to the admin for sales reporting and manage store from one integrated dashboard - from store order to payment, shipping, fulfillment, marketing and more.

9.Lessons learned 

We learned how to use MYSQL to connect, upload and download databases in the first version, and we are going to add more features and use them in the second version.
