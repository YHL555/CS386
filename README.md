1. Description
Our project is to build an e-commerce store. By using our software, sellers can create their own web pages and manage their own web pages very easily. Sellers can add more than one administrator. Every administrator can edit the web pages. For example, putting new items on the web pages or hiding existing items, adding descriptions to items, and categorizing items already on the web pages. Managers can also upload pictures of goods so that consumers can shop more conveniently. Consumers can shop freely through our website. Add your favorite items to your shopping cart and change the number of products in the shopping cart.

Our e-commerce store can provide a takeaway website for some small businesses. And some new brands can use our e-store to set up their own official websites. Our goal is to facilitate entrepreneurs and help them grow their businesses. Because our online store is free of charge.

2. Verification (tests)
2.3.2. https://github.com/YHL555/CS386/tree/master/public 
3. Validation (user evaluation) 
Script:
	Q1: Do you think our application is friendly, clear and operable?
	Q2: How do you compare our system to Amazon?
	Q3: What features do you think we need to improve or add to make our application more friendly?
Results:
             Private restaurant owner: I think this application is friendly and easy to operate. Compared with Amazon, your web page is a bit simpler. It would be better if there is a thank you page after the payment is successful.
             Private grocery store owner: I think this application has a clear interface and easy to use. Compared with Amazon, your software is easier to read and understand. Amazon is rich in content but very complicated. I think it would be better if there were more payment methods.

Reflections: Payment, shopping cart and login functions are very easy to use. I feel that after the payment is successful, we can add a thank you shopping page to increase user friendliness. Our software system is simple and easy to learn and easy to operate. Users like our simple system, and the value proposition has been realized.
