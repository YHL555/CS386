1.Description: Our project is to build an e-commerce store. By using our software, sellers can create their own web pages and manage their own web pages very easily. Sellers can add more than one administrator. Every administrator can edit the web pages. For example, putting new items on the web pages or hiding existing items, adding descriptions to items, and categorizing items already on the web pages. Managers can also upload pictures of goods so that consumers can shop more conveniently. Consumers can shop freely through our website. Add your favorite items to your shopping cart and change the number of products in the shopping cart. Our e-commerce store can provide a takeaway website for some small businesses. And some new brands can use our e-store to set up their own official websites. Our aim is to provide convenience for entrepreneurs, as our e-store is a free service.
